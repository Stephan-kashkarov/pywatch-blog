# Holidays

Over the holidays not much work was done on the project at all. Not much of anything really was done but it sure was relaxing. There was a bit of work however it was not related to the project in an integral way.

work done over the holidays includes:
1. First PCB design (for the motorcycle thing)
2. learning of react and flutter
3. PECAN CTF

## PCB
I have now finally designed my first PCB. This experience has shown me the process of taking a circuit schematic and
changing it into a printable format. This will prove very useful in my final design

## Frameworks
Recently I have been creating react and flutter applications in my spare time.
After learning said frameworks I have realised that their structure is very simmilar
to that of my own framework. This will help with future OS design as well as the online store

## unrelated
we came second in pecan but that is unrelated
